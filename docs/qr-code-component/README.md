## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Steps I took (Currently - plan of steps I plan to take to complete the project)
- [x] - Read [the style guide](./style-guide.md)
- [x] - Created [style.css](./style.css), linked to it in the HTML, and added variables to it for each of the styles described in the style guide.
- [] - Added semantic markup to the HTML to break the content into proper elements
- [] - Created CSS classes to style the page for mobile
- [] - Tested the page for mobile
- [] - Checked the page for tablet and laptop widths to identify any styles that need to change for screens larger than mobile. No changes were necessary.
- [] - Screenshot the finished project and added the image to this README
- [] - Published the project to GitHub Pages

### Continued development

This project didn't require flexbox or CSS grid. I look forward to using them in future projects when it makes sense to do so.
