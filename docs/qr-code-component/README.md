## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Steps I took (Currently - plan of steps I plan to take to complete the project)
- [x] - Read [the style guide](./style-guide.md)
- [x] - Created [style.css](./style.css), linked to it in the HTML, and added variables to it for each of the styles described in the style guide.
- [x] - Added semantic markup to the HTML to break the content into proper elements
- [x] - Created CSS classes to style the page for mobile
- [x] - Tested the page for mobile
- [x] - Checked the page for tablet and laptop widths to identify any styles that need to change for screens larger than mobile. No changes were necessary.
- [x] - Screenshot the finished project and added the image to this README
- [x] - Published the project to GitHub Pages

### Continued development

This project didn't require flexbox or CSS grid. I look forward to using them in future projects when it makes sense to do so.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties ) - This helped me simplify the solution by putting all the design mandated selections into variables that I could use throughout the CSS. This sets everything up so that if a design choice is changed later, I'll only need to reset the custom property in :root instead of throughout the CSS.
- [CSS Calc()](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/) - Useful guide for using `calc()` in CSS to compute a value, such as a width, relative to some other value (I used it to set the width of the component to the mobile width minus a margin, so that there would be some space on either side of the component when viewed on mobile)
- [Relative units](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem) - by using REM units for font sizes I resized the various text based on a percentage of the font size used in the body element.
